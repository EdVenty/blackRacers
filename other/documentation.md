The chassis of our robot is made from Lego technic.
It can be collected in half an hour. The main electronics are on the top level of the robot (picture of the robot). Before the races, we fully check the robot, all components for damage and lack of contact. For more information about the algorithm of the program and its loading, you can read in ``README.md``.
