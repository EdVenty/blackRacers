We took the chassis for our robot from a children's car.
The robot is assembled in 4 hours. The main electronics are on the top level of the robot (picture of the robot). Before the races, we fully check the robot, all components for damage and lack of contact. You can read more about the algorithm of the program and its loading in ``README.md``.
